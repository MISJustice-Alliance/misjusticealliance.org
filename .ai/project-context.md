# MISJustice Alliance - Project Context

## Executive Summary

**misjusticealliance.org** is the public-facing website for the Anonymous Legal Assistance Group, a privacy-first legal advocacy platform dedicated to defending constitutional and civil rights. This platform serves as a resource directory, anonymous intake system, and advocacy tool for individuals facing systemic corruption and institutional abuse.

## Organization Profile

### Mission Statement

The Anonymous Legal Assistance Group (MISJustice Alliance) is an independent, non-profit civil litigation advocacy collective dedicated to defending the constitutional and civil rights of individuals who have been victimized by systemic corruption and misconduct within legal, governmental, and institutional frameworks.

### Core Purpose

We exist to shine a public light on private and public institutions whose conduct demonstrates clear patterns of systemic corruption and misconduct that victimizes innocent individuals. Our particular focus centers on institutions whose sheer size, power, or jurisdictional scope enables them to overwhelm the resources any single individual could reasonably marshal in their own defense.

### Organizational Values

1. **Justice Through Collective Action**: Coordinated legal expertise can effectively challenge even the most powerful institutions
2. **Protection Through Anonymity**: Anonymous structure ensures volunteers and clients can pursue justice without fear of retaliation
3. **Transparency in Accountability**: While protecting individual identities, we bring institutional misconduct into public light
4. **Empowerment Through Knowledge**: We educate and empower individuals to understand their rights and navigate complex legal systems

## Areas of Expertise

The organization focuses on cases involving:

- **Civil Rights Violations**: Constitutional deprivations and civil liberties abuses
- **Police Misconduct**: Law enforcement abuse of power, excessive force, false arrest
- **Prosecutorial Misconduct**: Malicious prosecution, Brady violations, selective enforcement
- **Legal Malpractice**: Attorney negligence, conflicts of interest, breach of fiduciary duty
- **Institutional Corruption**: Government agencies and non-profit organization abuse
- **Inter-jurisdictional Coordination**: Multi-agency harassment and abuse patterns
- **Whistleblower Retaliation**: First Amendment retaliation, employment discrimination

## How We Serve

1. **Comprehensive Case Review**: Legal analysis of civil rights violations and systemic misconduct

4. **Case Narrative Development**: Documenting patterns of institutional abuse and corruption
